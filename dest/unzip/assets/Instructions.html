<h2>MastTuner for Android - Instructions</h2>
  <p> (NOTE: This should be done on a day with no wind, with the
    boat perfectly horizontal. Move things around if you have
    to, to balance the boat). </p>
  <p>Disclaimer: Although MastTuner will help you
        identify misalignments in the mast, rigging work is best done
        by a professional rigger. Improperly tensioned shrouds and
        stays can lead to all kinds of expensive problems including
        mast and deck hardware failures. If you do decide to do your
        own work, educate yourself, buy the right tools (at a minimum
        buy a Loos gauge), and get advice from a pro. </p>

  <p>You have to look closely to see the green horizontal and
        vertical lines in this picture. The small black box in the
        center of the screen is showing the degrees of tilt.</p>
  <p>Viewing the boat from the bow or stern, hold the horizontal
      line at 0, and align the vertical line with the mast. </p>
  <p>If you look closely, you can see that the top of the mast
        looks a bit warped. The side stays are keeping the mast straight
        up to the spreaders but from there the mast bends slightly
        to port. The port and starboard shrouds are not set correctly.
        You can verify this by standing at the base of the mast
        and sighting up. </p>
        <p>With MastTuner, you can also able to check
        the rake of the mast. </p>
  <p>To measure the angle of the mast, tilt the phone so that
        the verticle green line lays along the mast. The readout displays
        the angle in degrees. If you prefer, the configuration menu
        will give you the option of displaying the readout in inches/foot,
        millimeters/meter, or percent.</p>
